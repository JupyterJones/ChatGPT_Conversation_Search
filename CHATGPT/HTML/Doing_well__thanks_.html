Doing well, thanks!<br />

Well, how are you doing today?<br />
ChatGPT<br />
I'm doing great, Jack! Thanks for asking. How about you? How's your day going?<br />
user<br />
Hey, fine, I'm fooling with the new chat on my computer.<br />
ChatGPT<br />
That sounds fun! Exploring new tech is always exciting. How are you finding the new chat so far?<br />
user<br />
So far, so good. I'm hoping that I can get it to speak back and forth in voice.<br />
ChatGPT<br />
That sounds like a cool project! Are you planning to integrate a speech recognition system as well?<br />
user<br />
I've got a chat going, but I have to type it in.<br />
ChatGPT<br />
Got it. If you're looking to add voice input, you might want to check out libraries like SpeechRecognition in Python. It can help convert spoken words into text, which you can then use for your chat interface.<br />
