Ragnar Lothbrok is a legendary Norse figure often associated with Viking history and mythology. He was a semi-legendary Viking chieftain and hero who is said to have lived during the 9th century. According to legend, Ragnar was a fearless warrior and a cunning strategist, known for his raids on Anglo-Saxon England and Francia.<br />
<br />
One of the most famous tales involving Ragnar is his raid on the monastery at Lindisfarne in 793 AD, which is often considered the beginning of the Viking Age. He is also a central character in the popular TV series "Vikings," where his exploits are dramatized and expanded upon. However, separating historical fact from legend can be challenging, and much of what is known about Ragnar comes from sagas and later medieval writings rather than contemporary records.<br />
