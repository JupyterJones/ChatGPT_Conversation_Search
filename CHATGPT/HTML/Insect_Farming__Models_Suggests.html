Hey Jack! Exploring alternative food sources, huh? Entomophagy, or the consumption of insects, is gaining traction for its sustainability. Here are a few insects you might consider:<br />
<br />
1. **Mealworms:** High in protein, easy to raise, and versatile in recipes.<br />
2. **Crickets:** Nutrient-dense and environmentally friendly.<br />
3. **Black Soldier Fly Larvae:** Efficient waste processors and rich in protein.<br />
4. **Grasshoppers:** Abundant and a good source of protein.<br />
5. **Silkworms:** High in protein, though often more popular in certain cuisines.<br />
<br />
If you're interested, I could help you explore recipes or even automate some aspects of insect farming with Python. What do you think, Jack?<br />
