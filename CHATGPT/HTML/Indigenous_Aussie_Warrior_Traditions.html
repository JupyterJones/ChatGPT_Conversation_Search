What group makes faces and yells<br />
ChatGPT<br />
The group you are referring to is likely the Maori of New Zealand, particularly in the context of the **haka**, a traditional war dance. The Maori are indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand, known for their rich cultural traditions, including the haka.<br />
<br />
The haka is a ceremonial dance that involves rhythmic movements, chanting, facial expressions, and stomping of the feet. Here are a few key points about the haka:<br />
<br />
1. **Purpose**: Historically, the haka was performed by warriors before battle to intimidate the opponent and to build up strength and unity among the warriors. Today, it is performed during various ceremonies and celebrations to honor guests, at sports events, and during important social functions.<br />
<br />
2. **Facial Expressions**: The haka includes intense facial expressions such as wide eyes and the protrusion of the tongue. These expressions are meant to convey fierceness and strength.<br />
<br />
3. **Chanting**: The words of the haka often reflect themes of challenge, determination, and ancestral heritage. The chanting is loud and forceful, meant to communicate power and resolve.<br />
<br />
4. **Famous Haka**: One of the most famous haka is "Ka Mate," which was composed by the Maori chief Te Rauparaha in the early 19th century. It is often performed by New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, before their matches.<br />
<br />
While the Maori are based in New Zealand, the cultural similarities and shared Polynesian heritage often lead to confusion with Indigenous Australian groups. However, it is specifically the Maori who are renowned for their haka and the associated facial expressions and vocalizations.<br />
