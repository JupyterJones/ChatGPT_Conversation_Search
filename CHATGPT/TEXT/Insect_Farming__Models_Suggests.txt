Hey Jack! Exploring alternative food sources, huh? Entomophagy, or the consumption of insects, is gaining traction for its sustainability. Here are a few insects you might consider:

1. **Mealworms:** High in protein, easy to raise, and versatile in recipes.
2. **Crickets:** Nutrient-dense and environmentally friendly.
3. **Black Soldier Fly Larvae:** Efficient waste processors and rich in protein.
4. **Grasshoppers:** Abundant and a good source of protein.
5. **Silkworms:** High in protein, though often more popular in certain cuisines.

If you're interested, I could help you explore recipes or even automate some aspects of insect farming with Python. What do you think, Jack?
